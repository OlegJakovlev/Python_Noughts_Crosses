# Tic-Tac-Toe game
## About
This project is part of Programming Fundamentals assignments.

The main goal was to create a game based on Python with 2 modes:

* PvE
* PvP

As well as to follow OOP principles and applying different algorithms.

To optimize the game and make AI unbetabble, I have used:
 * Minimax with alpha-beta prunning algorithm
